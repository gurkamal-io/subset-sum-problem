# subset-sum-problem
A version of the subset sum problem is a pair (S, t), where S = {x1, x2, ... xn} is a set of positive integers and t (the target) is a positive integer. The problem asks for a subset of S whose sum is as large as possible, but not larger than t. The problem has many useful applications. In transportation, we may have a truck that can carry at most t pounds, and we wish to maximize the load based on a loading dock filled with packages with varying discrete weights. A radio show host or program manager may want to select group of tunes or commercials from a set whose total running time is as close to the duration of the show or commercial break (perhaps three hour FM music show, or a two minute commercial break) without going over the time allotment. The left-over time can easily be filled with talk or station identification.
